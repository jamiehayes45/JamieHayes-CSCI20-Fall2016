// write up description 
// lab2 algorithm computer will generate a random number, and a user must guess it correctly to win
 
 /*set the variables comptNumber
 * set the variable randomNumber
 * set the variable 'score' // 10 points within score
 
 * set a range for the computer to choose a random number from via 1-10
 * set the computer to choose a random number between the range
 * save it withn the variable comptNumber
 * cin a users guess, and save it in randomNumber
 * compare it to computers number using a loop
 
 *if the users number is higher than the computer number tell the user lower, and deduct one point from the total score
 *if the user number is lower than the computer number, tell the user higher, and deduct one point from the totla score
 *if the user number is the same as the computer number, thell them they got it right, and earn a point
 * continue for ten rounds 
 *add total score points
 *tell user if they won or lost depending on how many rounds they win out of ten
